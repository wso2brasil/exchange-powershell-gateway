# To specify a configuration file explicitly, use the `--b7a.config.file=<path_to_configuration_file>` property.
# If this property is not set, Ballerina looks for a `ballerina.conf` file in the current directory. The path
# to the configuration file can be either an absolute or a relative path.
# To run this example, place the following configurations in a file and provide its path.
# ```
# [hello.http]
#  port=8085
# [hello.keystore]
#  password="@encrypted:{69P5VGO+hOomLWhoY28gJiGPmBzWvzlmGGWA9X3uWZM=}"
